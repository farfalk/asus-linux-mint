# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project follows Linux Mint release versioning with patch numbers.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `update-asus-linux.sh`: update an existing installation to the latest upstream release tag. The pinned tag is built from source, staged with upstream's own Makefile rules, wrapped in an `asusctl-ogc` `.deb` and installed with apt, so dpkg tracks the installed version, removes files dropped by upstream on upgrade, and makes rollback possible. Supports `--check`, `--tag`, `--rollback`, `--no-gui` and an optional notify-only weekly systemd timer.
- README: "Updating" section covering the update, rollback and package-removal workflow.

### Changed
- change asusctl repository to https://github.com/OpenGamingCollective/asusctl following gitlab repo archival
- Remove supergfxctl following the announced phase out (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Supergfxctl)
- CI: check `update-asus-linux.sh`, and validate the GitHub asusctl repository instead of the archived GitLab one.

### Fixed
- Installer: drop `cargo build --locked`. Upstream does not commit a `Cargo.lock`, so cargo refuses to create one and every build failed with "cannot create the lock file ... because --locked was passed". Upstream removed `--locked` from their own Makefile for the same reason.
- Updater: install `asusd-user.service` explicitly. Upstream declares `install-data-asusd_user` as `.PHONY` but gives it no recipe, so `make install` silently skips the user unit.

## [22.3.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- README: add troubleshooting guidance for Cinnamon/X11 screen brightness issues on hybrid AMD/NVIDIA ASUS laptops.
- Uninstaller: prompt to remove `/etc/asusd` runtime configuration directory (preserves user-customised fan curves, profiles, and LED settings by default).

### Fixed
- Installer: create `/etc/asusd` before starting `asusd.service` to prevent `status=226/NAMESPACE` failures on fresh installs. The upstream unit declares `ProtectSystem=strict` with `ReadWritePaths=/etc/asusd/`, so systemd refuses to set up the unit's mount namespace if the directory is missing.

### Thanks
- Thanks to @cyntalan for reporting the `asusd.service` start failure and tracking down the workaround in issue #5.

## [22.3.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- Target Linux Mint 22.3 (Zena) only.

### Changed
- Scripts: set minimum supported Mint to 22.3.
- README: update requirements and kernel section for Mint 22.3.

### Fixed
- Installer: post-install messages now correctly reflect whether `rog-control-center` GUI was installed.

## [22.2.2] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- Prevent `rog-control-center` build failures on fresh Mint installs by installing the required GUI dependencies (e.g. `libfontconfig1-dev`).
- Prevent `rog-control-center` panics on X11 sessions by building with X11 support enabled.
- Install `asusd.service` more reliably and improve service discovery when enabling units.

### Changed
- Installer: add core build deps `cmake` and `libssl-dev`.
- Installer: install `rog-control-center` by default; set `ASUS_INSTALL_ROG_GUI=0` to opt out.

### Thanks
- Thanks to @NoonyaBeeznus for the detailed report and logs in issue #2.

## [22.2.1] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- Prevent the install script from re-running `cargo build` as root, avoiding git fetch failures for `slint` when network access is restricted.
- Limit privilege escalation to file installation so builds reuse the user environment and finish reliably.

## [22.2.0] - 2025-09-06

### Added
- Target Linux Mint 22.2 (Zara) only.

### Changed
- README: simplify kernel section to reflect Mint 22.2’s default HWE kernel 6.14; keep optional mainline instructions.
- Scripts: set minimum supported Mint to 22.2; align kernel guidance to 6.14; correct HWE meta-packages to `linux-generic`/`linux-headers-generic`.
- CI: update release requirements text to “Linux Mint 22.2 (Zara)”.

### Fixed
- Uninstall script header label and version alignment.

## [22.1.3] - 2025-07-16

### Added
- **Accurate kernel version guidance** distinguishing between HWE and mainline kernels
- **Mainline kernel installation instructions** for optimal ASUS support (6.12+)
- **Multi-tier kernel support documentation** (Basic 6.1+, Good 6.8+, Optimal 6.12+)
- **Helper functions** for HWE kernel installation and mainline kernel guidance
- **Comprehensive kernel installation options** with safety warnings

### Enhanced
- **Corrected kernel availability information** - HWE provides up to ~6.8, not 6.12+
- **Improved kernel detection logic** with realistic expectations for standard repositories
- **Better user guidance** on when to use HWE vs mainline kernels
- **Enhanced README structure** with expandable mainline installation section
- **More accurate installation prompts** based on what's actually available

### Fixed
- **Critical correction**: Kernel 6.12+ requires mainline installation, not available via HWE
- **Misleading kernel recommendations** that suggested 6.12+ was available through standard repos
- **Installation script promises** that couldn't be fulfilled with standard package managers

### Technical Improvements
- **ASUS WMI driver enhancements**: Better thermal profile initialization (6.12+ mainline)
- **Intel Lunar Lake performance**: ~22% improvement on ASUS laptops (6.12+ mainline)
- **ROG Ally support**: Enhanced suspend/resume functionality (6.12+ mainline)
- **Mini-LED support**: 2024 ROG laptop compatibility (6.12+ mainline)
- **GPU MUX switching**: Improved Vivobook series support (6.12+ mainline)
- **Realistic HWE benefits**: Up to kernel 6.8 through standard repositories

## [22.1.2] - 2025-01-28

### Added
- **System firmware updates** via fwupd for optimal hardware compatibility
- **Kernel compatibility checking** with automatic upgrade options for ASUS hardware support
- **NVIDIA driver preparation** with nouveau blacklist creation (`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf`)
- **Enhanced dependency management** including linux-firmware package
- **Dynamic kernel version support** with configurable minimum and recommended versions
- **Improved uninstall process** with nouveau blacklist removal option
- **Comprehensive firmware update flow** with error handling and user feedback
- **Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel installation** for better ASUS laptop support

### Enhanced
- Installation process now includes firmware updates for BIOS, EC, and device compatibility
- Better kernel version management with automatic upgrade suggestions
- Improved error handling for firmware update scenarios
- Enhanced documentation with troubleshooting sections
- Updated README with comprehensive feature list and usage examples

### Fixed
- Added missing essential dependencies for optimal hardware support
